We, get answers to the questions `What... is your name?`, `What... is your quest?` i.e.`Sir Lancelot of Camelot` and `To seek the Holy Grail.` respectively.

Then, question asks for the secret and compares the variable `local_18` to `0xdea110c8` and prints the flag if they are equal. But `local_18` is set `=0`. So, as `local_18` is stored on the stack and `gets` function is called for `local_43`, we can overwrite the value of `local_18`.

We can see that there is offset of `0x43-0x18 = 0x2b` between `local_43` i.e. start of the input and `local_18`.

Exploit:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
# This exploit template was generated via:
# $ pwn template pwn1
from pwn import *

# Set up pwntools for the correct architecture
exe = context.binary = ELF(args.EXE or 'pwn1')

# Many built-in settings can be controlled on the command-line and show up
# in "args".  For example, to dump all data sent/received, and disable ASLR
# for all created processes...
# ./exploit.py DEBUG NOASLR
